# Introduction

Welcome to the go-pesa library. You can use this library to access M-Pesa's REST API in a simple way. It is built with love in golang. This allows the creation of bindings in any language that supports C bindings. 

<!-- Currently, we have language bindings in Shell, Ruby, and Python! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right. -->

<!-- This example API documentation page was created with [Slate](https://github.com/tripit/slate). Feel free to edit it and use it as a base for your own API's documentation. -->
